# CONTRIBUTING

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the forked repo
3. Make a new branch with an appropriate name.
4. Make the necessary changes and make the pull request with `origin:master`


## Guidelines

* The branch name should be clearly descriptive of the issue it tries to resolve
* Same goes for the Pull request. Sufficient description allows the maintainers to not spend too much time looking for it in the files
* Make sure that your branch is in sync with the master before making a PR
* If changes are requsted after the PR, you are to make the changes in the same branch and push them. The PR will update automatically
* While adding new problems, make sure they remain as closely identical to the original [FreeCodeCamp problem](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/coding-interview-prep/project-euler)

* The solutions are expected to have a main method or its nearest equivalent
* The solutions must have an included timer that measures the execution of the main function in preferrable time unit
* The solutions to the problems is expected to be optimal
* Spaces of two or tabs of size two are appreciated
* The folder naming convention is `Pb- *problem number* *problem name*`
* The file naming convention is `pb- *problem number* . *extension*`

* Feel free to write your own solutions if you wish
