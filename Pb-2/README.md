# Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed **nth** term, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Eg.

1. ```fiboEvenSum(10)``` should return 10
2. ```fiboEvenSum(23)``` should return 10
3. ```fiboEvenSum(43)``` should return 44

Help
* The function always returns an *even* value
