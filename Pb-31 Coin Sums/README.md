# Problem 31

In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:

1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p) and £2 (200p).

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p

How many different ways can £(**n**) be made using any number of coins

Eg.

1. ```coinSums(50)``` should return 451
2. ```coinSums(100)``` should return 4563
3. ```coinSums(150)``` should return 21873
4. ```coinSums(200)``` should return 73682
