# Problem 12

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

1: 1

3: 1, 3

6: 1, 2, 3, 6

10: 1, 2, 5, 10

15: 1, 3, 5, 15

21: 1, 3, 7, 21

28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

What is the value of the first triangle number to have over **n** divisors

Eg.

1. ```divisibleTriangleNumber(5)``` should return 28
2. ```divisibleTriangleNumber(23)``` should return 630
3. ```divisibleTriangleNumber(167)``` should return 1385280
4. ```divisibleTriangleNumber(374)``` should return 17907120
5. ```divisibleTriangleNumber(500)``` should return 76576500
