# Problem 34 Digit Factorials

145 is a curious number, as 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Find the numbers and the sum of the numbers which are equal to the sum of the factorial of their digits.

Note: as 1! = 1 and 2! = 2 are not sums they are not included

Eg.

1. ```digitFactorial()``` should return { sum: 40730, numbers: [145, 40585] }
