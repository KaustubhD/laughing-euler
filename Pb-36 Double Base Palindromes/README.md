# Problem 36 Double Base Palindromes

The decimal number, 585 = 10010010012 (binary), is palindromic in both bases.

Find the sum of all numbers, less than n, whereas 1000 <= **n** <= 1000000, which are palindromic in base 10 and base 2.

(Please note that the palindromic number, in either base, may not include leading zeros.)

Eg.

1. ```doubleBasePalindromes(1000)``` should return 1772
2. ```doubleBasePalindromes(50000)``` should return 105795
3. ```doubleBasePalindromes(500000)``` should return 286602
4. ```doubleBasePalindromes(1000000)``` should return 872187
