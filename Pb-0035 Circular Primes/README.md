# Problem 35 Circular Primes

The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

How many circular primes are there below n, whereas 100 <= **n** <= 1000000

Eg.

1. ```circularPrimes(100)``` should return 13
2. ```circularPrimes(100000)``` should return 43
3. ```circularPrimes(250000)``` should return 45
4. ```circularPrimes(500000)``` should return 49
5. ```circularPrimes(750000)``` should return 49
6. ```circularPrimes(1000000)``` should return 55
