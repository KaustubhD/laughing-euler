# Problem 30

Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:

1634 = 1<sup>4</sup> + 6<sup>4</sup> + 3<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup>

8208 = 8<sup>4</sup> + 2<sup>4</sup> + 0<sup>4</sup> + 8<sup>4</sup>

9474 = 9<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup> + 7<sup>4</sup> + 4<sup>4</sup>

As 1 = 1<sup>4</sup> is not a sum it is not included.

The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of n powers of their digits

Eg.

1. ```digitnPowers(2)``` should return 0
2. ```digitnPowers(3)``` should return 1301
3. ```digitnPowers(4)``` should return 19316
4. ```digitnPowers(5)``` should return 443839
