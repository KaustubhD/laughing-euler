# Problem 28

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

21 22 23 24 25

20  7  8  9 10

19  6  1  2 11

18  5  4  3 12

17 16 15 14 13

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a **n by n** spiral formed in the same way?

Eg.

1. ```spiralDiagonals(101)``` should return 692101
2. ```spiralDiagonals(303)``` should return 18591725
3. ```spiralDiagonals(505)``` should return 85986601
4. ```spiralDiagonals(1001)``` should return 669171001
