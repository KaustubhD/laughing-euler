# Problem 24

A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order. The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:

012 021 102 120 201 210

What is the **nth** lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?

Eg.

1. ```lexicographicPermutations(699999)``` should return 1938246570
2. ```lexicographicPermutations(899999)``` should return 2536987410
3. ```lexicographicPermutations(900000)``` should return 2537014689
