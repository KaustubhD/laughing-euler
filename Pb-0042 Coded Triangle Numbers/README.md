# Problem 42 Coded Triangle Numbers

The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using words array of **n**-length, how many are triangle words

Eg.

1. ```codedTriangleNumbers(1400)``` should return 129
2. ```codedTriangleNumbers(1500)``` should return 137
3. ```codedTriangleNumbers(1600)``` should return 141
4. ```codedTriangleNumbers(1786)``` should return 162
