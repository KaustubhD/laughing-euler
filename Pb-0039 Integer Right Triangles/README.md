# Problem 39 Integer Right Triangles

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides, {a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

{20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ **n**, is the number of solutions maximised

Eg.

1. ```intRightTriangles(500)``` should return 420
2. ```intRightTriangles(800)``` should return 420
3. ```intRightTriangles(900)``` should return 840
4. ```intRightTriangles(1000)``` should return 840
