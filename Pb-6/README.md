# Problem 6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 552 = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first **n** natural numbers and the square of the sum

Eg.

1. ```sumSquareDifference(10)``` should return 2640
2. ```sumSquareDifference(20)``` should return 41230
3. ```sumSquareDifference(100)``` should return 25164150
