# Problem 26

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> = 0.5
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> = 0.(3)
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> = 0.25
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>5</sub> = 0.2
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>6</sub> = 0.1(6)
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> = 0.(142857)
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> = 0.125
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>9</sub> = 0.(1)
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>  = 0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that <sup>1</sup>/<sub>7</sub> has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < **n** for which <sup>1</sup>/<sub>d</sub> contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

Eg.

1. ```reciprocalCycles(700)``` should return 659
2. ```reciprocalCycles(800)``` should return 743
3. ```reciprocalCycles(900)``` should return 887
4. ```reciprocalCycles(1000)``` should return 983
